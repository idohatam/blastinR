\title{Check if BLAST+ is Installed and Accessible}
\usage{
check_blast_install(blpath = "makeblastdb")
}
\arguments{
\item{blpath}{A character string specifying the BLAST+ command to check.
Defaults to \code{"makeblastdb"}.}
}
\value{
A character message confirming that BLAST+ is correctly installed and the path is set.
Throws an error if the executable is not found.
}
\description{
This function checks whether the BLAST+ suite is installed and whether the specified command
(e.g., \code{makeblastdb}) is available in the system's executable search path.
It can be used interactively or internally to validate the environment.
}
\details{
This function uses \code{Sys.which()} to search for the specified BLAST+ tool
in the system's \code{PATH}. If the tool is not found, the function stops with an error
message prompting the user to check their BLAST+ installation.

Currently, only the system \code{PATH} is searched, but support for specifying custom paths
may be added in future versions (e.g., for use with containers or virtual environments).
